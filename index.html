<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/man-accidentally-killed-himself-taking-a-gun-selfie-2014-8">Oscar Otero Aguilar </a>went out for a night of drinking with his two friends one weekend in Mexico City. Like a number of 21 year olds, Aguilar reached for his phone to take a picture of his night. As he posed for his selfie, he lifted up his .45-caliber pistol and pointed it towards himself. The night ended tragically when Aguilar accidently shot and killed himself when he accidently pulled the trigger.  </p>

<p>
The tragedy that occurred to Aguilar is not novel; there has been a growing amount of selfie-related injuries occurring worldwide, dating as early as 2011. Over 192 incidents have occurred since then and has caused injuries and even death to some individuals.  </p>

<p>

The amount of injuries and deaths caused by accidents occurring while taking a selfie is not concrete. However, a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/selfie-related-injuries/metadata"> dataset </a> aggregated with incidents recorded in the news and created by data scientist, Shivam Bansal, shows that over 190 incidents have occurred since 2011. Though it does not account for the total amount of selfie-related injuries and deaths, it is one of the most comprehensive datasets regarding this topic on the internet that is easily accessible to the public.

From Bansal's records of incidents, India stands out with having the largest incidents of selfie-related injuries and deaths out of all countries. The country has had 71 recorded events that happened between the years of 2014 and 2021. Animal attacks were the most common cause of these events with about 35% of all recorded incidents falling in this category. Electrocution (28%) and transportation-related injuries (19%) follow closely behind.</p>

<p>Preceding behind India is the United States and Russia with 18 and 14 incidents respectively. The ages of victims in these countries ranged from a ten-year-old getting hit by a train in Russia to a 43-year-old in Concrete, Washington dying from a similar series of events that occurred to Aguilar.</p>

<p> Though the remaining 36 countries where incidents of selfie-related injuries have been recorded only have a handful of cited incidents, extra precautions can be taken to prevent further injuries when those are doing such a mundane actvity. Possible action that can be taken to reduce the number of injuries and deaths from selfies include increasing awareness for 'selfitis' (a selfie addiction), increasing barriers and other protective materials around vulnerable areas (For India, this would be around animal habitats) and adding photobooths to public areas.
